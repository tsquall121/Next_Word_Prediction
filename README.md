# [Next_Word_Prediction](https://tsquall121.shinyapps.io/Next_Word_Prediction/)
This APP uses a n-gram text prediction algorithm to predict the next word(s) based on text entered by a user.
You have to type **at least one** word in the **Enter Word(s)** box.
Please allow a few seconds for the output to appear.
In addition, you can use the slider to choose **up to three** next word predictions. The top three predictions of next words will show accordingly.
